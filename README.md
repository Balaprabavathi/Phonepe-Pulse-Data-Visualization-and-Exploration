By integrating real-time data updates and extensive filtering options, the tool enhances the accessibility and utility of PhonePe Pulse data, empowering users to make informed decisions and uncover trends in digital transactions effortlessly.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- psycopg2
- Streamlit
- Plotly

## Problem Statement
The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data, process it, and create a user-friendly tool that visualizes the data in an insightful and interactive manner.

## Solution
1. Data Extraction: Clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data.
2. Data Transformation: Use Python and Pandas to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and formatting it for analysis.
3. Database Insertion: Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database using mysql-connector-python for efficient storage and retrieval.
4. Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly. The dashboard will feature various dynamic visualizations, including geo maps, and provide multiple 
   dropdown options for user interaction.
5. Data Retrieval: Fetch data from the MySQL database to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. Deployment: Ensure the dashboard is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Deploy the solution to make it publicly accessible.
